// ### 4. **Flight Booking System Seat Arrangement**
//    Build a program to manage seating arrangements in an airplane. You have `rows x columns` seats:
//    - Use nested `for` loops to track and mark each seat as "booked" or "available."
//    - Simulate a series of booking requests and check availability.
//    - Print the seating arrangement after all bookings, ensuring that middle seats are left vacant if possible.



// ### 5. **Dynamic Pricing for an E-commerce Platform**
//    Write a program that adjusts product prices based on demand. For each product:
//    - Use a `for` loop to simulate hourly demand and update the price based on demand spikes.
//    - Implement a rule that decreases the price if demand falls below a certain threshold.
//    - At the end, show the final price for each product and the time intervals when the prices changed.



// ### 6. **Stock Market Analyzer**
//    Create a program to track stock prices for multiple companies over a specified period.
//    - Use `for` loops to iterate over daily stock prices.
//    - Detect significant price changes (e.g., a 5% rise or drop) and alert when this occurs.
//    - Generate a report of all significant price change events with timestamps.



// ### 7. **Image Pixel Manipulation for Grayscale Conversion**
//    Given an image represented as a 2D matrix of RGB values, write a program that:
//    - Uses nested `for` loops to iterate through each pixel and calculate the grayscale equivalent.
//    - Modify the RGB values of each pixel to convert it to grayscale.
//    - Output the modified pixel values after the conversion.



// ### 8. **Patient Temperature Monitoring System**
//    Develop a system to monitor the temperatures of patients in a hospital over 24 hours.
//    - Use a `for` loop to record hourly temperatures for each patient.
//    - Detect any abnormal temperature fluctuations (e.g., spikes above 100Â°F) and flag those instances.
//    - Print a summary of flagged instances for each patient at the end of the day.



// ### 9. **Data Encryption System for Text Messages**
//    Write a program that encrypts and decrypts messages.
//    - Use a `for` loop to iterate over each character in the message and apply a shift-based encryption (Caesar Cipher) based on a secret key.
//    - Ensure the loop correctly handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
//    - Decrypt the message at the end and verify the original message.



// ### 10. **Social Media Sentiment Analysis**
//    Create a program that analyzes the sentiment of posts in a dataset.
//    - Use a `for` loop to iterate through multiple posts and detect positive, neutral, or negative sentiment based on keywords.
//    - Track the number of posts in each category and output a summary.
//    - Calculate the percentage of positive vs. negative posts and show the overall sentiment.
